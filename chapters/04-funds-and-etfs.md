# Chapter 4 — Funds and ETFs
*The math settled the question decades ago. The retail world is still catching up.*

Let me offer you two bets.

Bet A: I flip one coin. Heads, you make 60%. Tails, you lose 40%. Expected return: +10%.

Bet B: I flip 100 independent coins. On each one, heads is +60%, tails is −40%. You receive the average outcome across all 100. Expected return: also +10%.

The expected returns are identical. The coins are identical. And yet almost nobody is indifferent between these bets. Almost everybody takes Bet B.

Why? Under Bet A, half the time you lose 40% of your money. Under Bet B, the chance of losing anything meaningful is vanishingly small — losing requires a preposterously unlucky run where tails vastly outnumbers heads across a hundred independent flips. Same average. Completely different variability. The gap between the average and the variability is where all of portfolio theory lives, and it is the mechanism behind every fund and ETF ever created.

This chapter builds that mechanism from scratch, then shows you what happens when you try to use it in the real world.

## The Only Free Lunch

The clean mathematical statement goes like this. Suppose you hold $N$ assets, each independent of the others, each with expected return $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. You hold equal weights — $1/N$ of your money in each. The portfolio return is the average:

$$R_p = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i$$

What is the expected return of this portfolio? The expectation of an average is the average of the expectations:

$$E[R_p] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} E[R_i] = \frac{1}{N} \cdot N \cdot \mu = \mu$$

The expected return is $\mu$ — the same as any individual asset. Diversification did not cost you any expected return. Pin that.

Now the variance. For independent random variables, variances add. The variance of the sum of $N$ independent assets is $N\sigma^2$. But we are averaging, not summing, and when you scale a random variable by a constant, variance scales by the constant *squared*:

$$\text{Var}(R_p) = \text{Var}\!\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i\right) = \frac{1}{N^2} \cdot N\sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{N}$$

Portfolio variance is the individual variance divided by $N$. Portfolio volatility is $\sigma / \sqrt{N}$.

![Volatility reduction curve ](images/04-funds-and-etfs-fig-01.png)
*Figure 4.1 — Volatility reduction curve *

That is the entire argument. Same expected return; volatility shrinks as one over the square root of the number of assets. Hold 4 independent assets and your volatility is halved. Hold 100 and it is one-tenth of any individual asset's volatility. The expected return has not moved.

This is the only free lunch finance offers with mathematical confidence. It is the reason pooled investment vehicles exist at all.

The word I have been careful to repeat is *independent*. The $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ result requires that assets move without correlation. In practice they don't. US large-cap stocks move together; in a recession most of them fall at the same time. The general formula, when correlation matters, separates into two terms:

$$\text{Var}(R_p) = \underbrace{\frac{\sigma^2}{N}}_{\text{shrinks to zero}} + \underbrace{\left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\right)\rho\sigma^2}_{\text{converges to } \rho\sigma^2}$$

As $N$ grows large, the first term vanishes and the second term approaches $\rho\sigma^2$. There is a floor. You cannot diversify below the average pairwise correlation times the variance. That residual is systematic risk — the risk that comes from forces affecting many assets simultaneously. The piece that does diversify away is idiosyncratic risk — the piece specific to each individual asset.

![Two-part decomposition of portfolio risk ](images/04-funds-and-etfs-fig-02.png)
*Figure 4.2 — Two-part decomposition of portfolio risk *

This distinction is worth holding precisely. Diversification eliminates the idiosyncratic piece. It does not touch the systematic piece. When the entire equity market falls, a hundred-stock portfolio falls with it. What diversification protects you against is the catastrophe specific to one company — the bankruptcy, the fraud, the product recall that wipes out one name while the rest of the world continues.

Which is why this is not just theoretically interesting.

## A Specific Problem

Maya is at her parents' house after Thanksgiving dinner. Her father — sixty years old, five years from retirement — pulls her aside.

> I have $400,000 in my 401(k). It's all in the company stock. My friends say I should diversify. The HR person says the same thing. But the stock has done well. The company has done well. What would you do?

Three things are simultaneously true about his situation. He has worked at this firm for thirty-one years. The stock has performed well. His entire retirement is a single bet on whether this one firm continues to exist and thrive.

The third truth is the one that matters, and it makes the other two beside the point.

The fact that the bet has paid off until now is not evidence it will keep paying off. It is evidence that he has been lucky, or right, or both, *up to now*. The mathematics of diversification says you can keep almost all the expected return of equity exposure while nearly eliminating the idiosyncratic risk of a single firm — without any cost, because expected return is not reduced by averaging. His entire situation is a problem that the mechanism above was designed to solve.

The question is what vehicle to use.

## Three Ways to Pool Money

You and I both want exposure to thousands of stocks without the time or capital to buy them individually. We want someone to pool our money with other investors' money and own the basket on our behalf. How should that pool be structured?

There are three answers, and they differ in ways that show up quietly in your account statement every year.

Picture three ways to buy fish.

The first way: you call the wholesaler. They tell you, at the end of the day, what a fair price was based on their costs that day. You pay that price, they send you fish. If more buyers want fish tomorrow, the wholesaler brings in more fish — supply expands to meet demand. This is an open-end mutual fund. The pool issues new shares whenever someone invests and redeems shares whenever someone withdraws, at end-of-day net asset value — the total fund value divided by shares outstanding, calculated once after market close. You cannot know your buy or sell price during the trading day.

The second way: you buy from another dealer in an open market. Long ago, someone assembled a pool of fish and sold rights to slices of it. Those rights now trade between buyers and sellers on an exchange. The price of a slice on any given day is whatever buyers and sellers agree it should be — it might be more than the slice is worth, it might be less. The original pool never grows or shrinks. This is a closed-end fund: fixed share count, exchange-traded, market price set by supply and demand. Closed-end funds routinely trade at premiums or discounts to NAV, sometimes 10% or more, and the discrepancy can persist for months because there is no mechanism that forces the two prices to converge.

The third way: you buy from dealers who have a special privilege. Same as the second way — slices trade on an exchange — but a class of professional traders called authorized participants can do something nobody else can: when the market price drifts away from NAV, they trade against the drift and are rewarded for doing so. Their action keeps the market price tethered to NAV throughout every trading day. This is an exchange-traded fund.

The authorized participant mechanism is the piece worth understanding in detail, because it is what separates ETFs from closed-end funds structurally.

Suppose an ETF is trading at \$100 on the exchange. Its underlying basket of stocks is worth \$99 in aggregate — that is its NAV. The ETF is overpriced by \$1. Here is what an authorized participant does: buy the basket of underlying stocks for \$99; deliver that basket to the fund; receive newly created ETF shares in exchange — this is called a creation; sell those ETF shares on the market for \$100. One dollar of profit per share, at essentially no risk. Authorized participants do this in volume — hundreds of thousands of shares at a time. The act of buying the underlying stocks pushes their prices up; the act of selling new ETF shares onto the market pushes the ETF price down. The gap closes.

![Two-panel diagram of the AP arbitrage loop — the steps an Authorized Participant takes to close a gap when an ETF trades above NAV (left) and below NAV (right)](images/04-funds-and-etfs-fig-01.png)
*Figure 4.1 — The AP arbitrage loop*

When the ETF trades *below* NAV, the mechanism reverses: buy ETF shares cheap on the market, redeem them with the fund for the underlying basket, sell the basket at full value. Same convergence, opposite direction. This is a redemption. The mechanism runs continuously, which is why liquid ETFs almost never deviate from NAV by more than a few basis points.

The mechanism also makes ETFs tax-efficient in a way mutual funds are not. When authorized participants redeem shares, the fund hands out appreciated stock in-kind rather than selling assets for cash — the fund never triggers a taxable capital gain that flows through to all shareholders. Mutual funds, lacking this mechanism, periodically distribute capital gains to shareholders who didn't sell anything and didn't want the tax event.

Why doesn't the same arbitrage work for closed-end funds? Because closed-end funds have no creation and redemption mechanism. The supply of shares is fixed. An authorized participant cannot create new shares when the price is too high or redeem shares when the price is too low. The only way to profit from the mispricing is to trade the secondary market, which pushes prices toward fair value slowly and imperfectly. Persistent discounts can survive for years.

## What Ownership Costs

Here is a number that surprises almost everyone the first time.

Two investors, both 30 years old, each put \$10,000 into funds that earn identical gross returns — 7% per year, the long-run nominal return on US equities [verify]. Both leave the money alone until retirement at 65. The only difference: one fund charges an expense ratio of 0.05% per year. The other charges 1.0%.

After 35 years:

$$\text{Low-fee:} \quad \$10{,}000 \times (1.0695)^{35} \approx \$103{,}900$$

$$\text{High-fee:} \quad \$10{,}000 \times (1.06)^{35} \approx \$76{,}900$$

The difference is \$27,000. On a \$10,000 initial investment. Same starting amount, same gross return, same investor, same time horizon. The high-fee investor has 26% less money at retirement.

The mechanism is worth understanding precisely. Let $g$ be the gross annual return and $e$ the expense ratio. Net return is $g - e$, and terminal wealth after $T$ years is:

$$V_T = V_0 (1 + g - e)^T$$

The fraction of terminal wealth lost to fees, relative to the zero-fee outcome, is:

$$\text{Fee Cost Fraction} = 1 - \left(\frac{1+g-e}{1+g}\right)^T$$

For $g = 7\%$, $e = 0.95\%$, $T = 35$: the fraction is $1 - (1.0605/1.07)^{35} \approx 26\%$.

What the formula reveals is that the cost of fees grows with horizon but at a decelerating rate. Early on, the fee is just the fee. Over time, you are also losing the compounded return on the money you already paid in fees — the money that would have grown for the remaining years but no longer can because it was extracted. That second-order effect grows with time, which is why the compounding of fees is always worse than a linear extrapolation suggests.

| Horizon | Low-fee (0.05%) | High-fee (1.0%) | Difference | % foregone |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 years | \$13,990 | \$13,380 | \$610 | 4.4% |
| 10 years | \$19,580 | \$17,900 | \$1,680 | 8.6% |
| 20 years | \$38,330 | \$32,030 | \$6,300 | 16.4% |
| 35 years | \$103,900 | \$76,900 | \$27,000 | 26.0% |

![Compounding fee drag over time ](images/04-funds-and-etfs-fig-03.png)
*Figure 4.3 — Compounding fee drag over time *

Over five years, the fee is nearly invisible. Over thirty-five years, it has consumed more than a quarter of the outcome.

The natural counterargument: what if the high-fee fund consistently outperforms by enough to offset the fee? A manager charging 1.0% who consistently beats the market by 1.5% costs you nothing net and gains you 0.5%. This is the case for active management. The empirical question is whether active managers actually deliver consistent net-of-fee outperformance in liquid public markets.

The data, accumulated over decades and surveyed repeatedly in the SPIVA reports [verify], shows that in liquid US large-cap equity, somewhere between 70% and 90% of active funds underperform their benchmark after fees over rolling 10-year windows [verify]. The fraction varies by asset class and period. The headline is durable.

This does not mean active management cannot work anywhere. There are markets — deep small-cap, distressed credit, frontier emerging markets — where information asymmetries are large enough that skilled managers might consistently extract value. The point is that the markets where most people actually invest are not those markets. In liquid, heavily analyzed, efficiently priced markets, the expected alpha from active management is close to zero before fees and negative after them. The fee is certain. The outperformance is not.

## Applying All Three Pieces

Now we bring diversification, vehicle structure, and fee arithmetic to Maya's father's actual problem.

Maya specifies carefully before prompting:

> My father has $400,000 in company stock, is 60 years old, retires in 5 years, and expects to draw down the portfolio over 20–30 years after that. Social Security and a small pension cover basic expenses; the 401(k) is supplementary income and eventual inheritance. He tolerates normal volatility but doesn't want to feel sick in a bad market. Use only Vanguard ETFs — low cost, easy for him to understand.

The specification does real work. Without naming the investor's horizon, purpose, and constraints, the prompt produces generic output. With it, the universe of reasonable answers narrows sharply. She prompts Claude to build a 60/40 stock-bond portfolio, allocated within stocks across US and international equity, and within bonds across intermediate-term and inflation-protected. The output:

| Ticker | Fund | Expense ratio | Allocation | Dollars |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| VTI | Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF | [verify] 0.03% | 40% | \$160,000 |
| VXUS | Vanguard Total International Stock ETF | [verify] 0.07% | 20% | \$80,000 |
| BND | Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF | [verify] 0.03% | 30% | \$120,000 |
| VTIP | Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF | [verify] 0.04% | 10% | \$40,000 |

Weighted average expense ratio: approximately 0.04% — about \$160 per year on the full portfolio.

Each choice is doing specific work. VTI is diversification made concrete: several thousand US stocks held through a single instrument, doing the work that Maya's father's 401(k) has been refusing to do. VXUS adds international developed and emerging-market equity — US equity dominance is a recent feature of the global landscape rather than a permanent one, and holding international diversifies away the country-specific risk that would otherwise sit on top of the single-firm risk the portfolio just escaped. BND provides a broadly diversified intermediate-term bond index. VTIP adds explicit inflation protection — when drawing down for 25 years, the real purchasing power of each withdrawal depends on how much inflation erodes the nominal balance over that period.

The 60/40 split is a conventional starting point, not a derived optimum. For someone five years from retirement with a twenty-plus year drawdown horizon, it is somewhat conservative on the equity side relative to what long-run return maximization would suggest — but appropriate relative to sequence-of-returns risk.

Sequence-of-returns risk is the disproportionate damage that poor markets in the early years of retirement do to portfolio sustainability. A 30% drawdown in year one of retirement is vastly more damaging than a 30% drawdown in year fifteen, because in year one you have more years of withdrawals ahead that will be funded from a permanently smaller base. The 40% bond allocation is partly insurance against this scenario: bonds tend to hold value or appreciate when equities fall, which partially cushions early-year drawdowns.

This is also why the vehicle choice matters beyond fees. ETFs allow intraday rebalancing — if equities fall 20% in a single month, Maya's father can rebalance back to 60/40 that afternoon without waiting for end-of-day NAV. In normal markets, irrelevant. In a fast-moving crisis, a day's lag is a real constraint.

Maya verifies the fund metadata against Vanguard's website directly [verify each ticker, expense ratio, holdings]. The numbers Claude reported match Vanguard's published data within rounding. The portfolio's equity-bond split checks internally: VTI 40% + VXUS 20% = 60% equity; BND 30% + VTIP 10% = 40% fixed income. Sum is 100%.

She also runs the fee comparison. If she had chosen actively managed funds for the equity sleeves — charging a more typical 0.85% [verify] — and held for 25 years at 7% gross, the fee drag on the \$160,000 US equity sleeve alone is roughly 17.7% of the passive terminal value — approximately \$143,000 on that sleeve alone [verify]. On the international sleeve, another \$50,000 or so. The cost of choosing active over passive for the equity allocation, across a 25-year horizon at normal gross returns, exceeds \$190,000 — extracted by the fee before any active manager has demonstrated they earned it.

The recommendation is not technically difficult. VTI, VXUS, BND, VTIP, at low cost, held for decades. What makes it a recommendation rather than an opinion is that each choice is grounded in the mechanism — diversification, vehicle structure, fee arithmetic — and each choice is verified against primary data rather than taken from memory.

## What the Structure Is Really Teaching

Step back and look at what this chapter has actually built.

The fund and ETF industry is, at its core, an institutional solution to a coordination problem. Individual investors want broad market exposure. Owning thousands of securities individually is impossible at reasonable cost. Funds pool capital so that the mechanics of diversification — the $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$ result — can be accessed by people who don't have the time, capital, or inclination to assemble thousands of individual positions.

The three structures are three different answers to this coordination problem, developed in three different eras and solving the preceding era's main failure. Closed-end funds came first [verify] and offered pooling and exchange trading — but their fixed share supply meant prices drifted from fair value with no correction mechanism. Open-end mutual funds fixed the pricing problem by allowing daily creation and redemption at NAV — but gave up intraday liquidity and introduced tax inefficiency. ETFs recovered intraday liquidity and tax efficiency by adding the authorized participant arbitrage mechanism. Each structure is a patch on the one before it.

| Structure | Share supply | Pricing mechanism | Intraday trading | NAV tracking | Tax efficiency | Era introduced |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Open-end mutual fund** | Variable — shares created/redeemed at NAV | One price per day, set at 4 PM | No — orders fill at end-of-day NAV | Exact (you transact at NAV) | Lower — taxable distributions when other holders redeem | 1924 (MFS Massachusetts Investors Trust) |
| **Closed-end fund** | Fixed at IPO; shares trade on exchange | Market price, can diverge from NAV | Yes | Often trades at a discount or premium to NAV | Mid — can use leverage and capital-loss harvesting | 1893 (UK), 1929 (US peak) |
| **ETF** | Variable — shares created/redeemed *in-kind* by APs | Market price, kept tight to NAV via arbitrage | Yes | Tight tracking via creation/redemption mechanism | High — in-kind creation defers capital gains | 1993 (SPY) |

*Each structure solved the preceding era's main failure: closed-end funds added intraday trading; ETFs added in-kind tax efficiency on top of intraday liquidity.*

The active-versus-passive debate is a relatively recent product of accumulated empirical evidence [verify]. For most of the twentieth century, active management was the default — the question of whether managers added value over a passive index wasn't even well-posed until index funds provided a measurable counterfactual. Once they did, evidence accumulated. The data, replicated across markets and decades, now makes a strong case for low-cost passive vehicles in core asset classes. The institutional world has largely moved. The retail world is still catching up.

Maya's father is late to a transition the institutional world made twenty years ago. The chapter's job — and Maya's job at the kitchen table — is to explain why the math already settled this.

---

## What Would Change My Mind

The chapter's recommendation toward low-cost passive vehicles in core equity and bond markets rests on the empirical finding that most active managers underperform their benchmark after fees over long horizons in liquid markets. That finding is robust in the published literature for US large-cap equity. It is weaker in some other segments.

If future evidence showed that a specific category of active management — identified in advance, not in hindsight — consistently and significantly outperformed passive after fees in a segment where retail investors typically allocate, the chapter's defaults would need to be revised for that segment.

I would also revise the strong version of the fee argument if evidence emerged that active managers in certain markets were able to reduce drawdowns during crises in ways that more than compensated for their fee drag over full cycles — specifically in the context of sequence-of-returns risk, where downside protection matters most. Some evidence exists for this effect in tactical allocation strategies [verify]. I don't find it conclusive at current fee levels, but it is the most serious version of the case for active.

## Still Puzzling

The 60/40 framework has worked historically because stocks and bonds tend to be negatively or lowly correlated — when one falls, the other often holds or rises, so the combination diversifies more than either asset alone. In 2022 [verify], both fell sharply together; the correlation assumption broke down. The portfolio still recovered, but the diversification benefit between the two major asset classes was absent during the period when it was most needed.

This raises a question the chapter does not fully answer: what is the right framework when the correlation structure of major asset classes is itself unstable? The standard answer — add more asset classes, seek lower pairwise correlations — is correct as far as it goes, but it is theoretically unsatisfying. The $\rho\sigma^2$ floor in the diversification formula depends on the correlations being the ones you estimated. If correlations are themselves uncertain and tend to spike during crises, the floor you calculated in normal markets may not be the floor you get when you need it most.

This is not a problem unique to 60/40. It is a problem with all portfolio construction that relies on historical correlations as inputs. I don't have a clean resolution. Chapter 10 addresses it in the context of mean-variance optimization more carefully.

---

*Coming up.* Funds and ETFs are the vehicles for holding diversified portfolios. The chapter has shown you how to choose between them and what they cost to own. What it has not shown you is how to value the cash flows they produce — the dividend stream, the withdrawal sequence in retirement, the question of whether the portfolio lasts as long as the investor does. That valuation rests on a single principle: a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, by an amount that depends on what you can earn in the meantime. Chapter 5 builds that principle from scratch and applies it to every kind of cash flow stream.

---

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

1. *(Diversification mechanics)* You hold a single stock with annualized volatility of 40%. If you replace it with an equal-weighted portfolio of 25 stocks, each with the same volatility and zero pairwise correlation, what is the portfolio's volatility? Show the calculation. Now suppose the average pairwise correlation is 0.3 — what is the floor you cannot diversify below?

2. *(AP arbitrage)* An ETF is trading at \$103 on the exchange. Its underlying basket of stocks has a total NAV of \$100. Describe, step by step, the trade an authorized participant would execute to profit from this discrepancy, and explain the mechanism by which each step pushes the two prices toward convergence.

3. *(Fee arithmetic)* An investor puts \$50,000 into a fund charging 0.75% annually. Gross return is 7% per year. Using the fee cost fraction formula, calculate what percentage of terminal wealth is lost to fees after 20 years. Then calculate the dollar amount foregone.

**Application**

4. *(Idiosyncratic vs. systematic risk)* Maya's father holds 100% of his retirement in one company's stock. Using the two-term variance formula, explain precisely which component of risk he is carrying that he would not carry in a diversified index fund — and which component survives regardless of how broadly he diversifies.

5. *(Specification practice)* A colleague says: "I want to put my emergency fund into a bond ETF." Write a complete five-element specification — decision, alternative, data window, assumptions, output shape — that would produce a defensible analysis rather than generic output. You do not need to run the analysis; just write the spec.

6. *(Vehicle selection)* An investor tells you they want a vehicle that (a) tracks a broad US equity index, (b) can be bought and sold during the trading day, (c) will not distribute unexpected capital gains, and (d) keeps fees below 0.10%. Which of the three fund structures satisfies all four constraints? Which structures fail, and on which specific constraint?

7. *(Fee comparison)* Two funds both track the S&P 500. Fund A charges 0.03%; Fund B charges 0.85%. An investor puts \$100,000 into each and holds for 30 years at 7% gross annual return. Calculate the terminal value of each and the total dollar difference. Then state: if Fund B's manager claimed they could justify the fee through superior risk management, how many basis points of annual outperformance would they need to exactly break even with Fund A over the same horizon?

**Synthesis**

8. *(All three mechanisms together)* Maya's father moves his \$400,000 from company stock into the VTI/VXUS/BND/VTIP portfolio described in the chapter. For each of the three mechanisms covered — diversification, vehicle structure, fee arithmetic — identify the specific improvement his new portfolio achieves relative to his old one, and the mechanism that explains why.

9. *(Sequence-of-returns risk)* The chapter claims a 30% drawdown in year one of retirement is more damaging than the same drawdown in year fifteen. Construct a simple numerical example — pick a starting balance, a fixed annual withdrawal amount, and a 30% one-year loss — to show the difference in portfolio sustainability between the two scenarios. What does this imply about the optimal equity allocation as an investor moves from accumulation into drawdown?

**Challenge**

10. *(Stress-test the correlation floor)* The $\rho\sigma^2$ floor assumes correlations are stable. In the 2022 example cited in "Still Puzzling," both US equities and US bonds fell sharply together — the historical negative correlation between the two asset classes temporarily reversed. If you were building a portfolio for a retiree who cannot tolerate the scenario where both equities and bonds fall simultaneously, what structural changes would you consider, and what new risks does each change introduce? There is no clean answer; argue for the approach you find least bad and explain what you would need to believe for it to hold.

###  LLM Exercise — Chapter 4: Funds and ETFs

**Project:** Maya's Memo, Built Across the Course
**What you're building this chapter:** The Fund-vs-Direct decision section of the memo: would an ETF or fund dominate direct ownership of this position, and on what evidence?
**Tool:** Claude Project

---

**The Prompt:**

```
I'm working on Maya's Memo for the position in `01-position-brief.md`. The framing so far: `02-return-risk.md`, `03-claim-framing.md`.

Chapter 4 introduced:
- **The law-of-large-numbers argument**: a 100-coin bet at +60% / -40% has the same expected value as a 1-coin bet, with massively lower variance
- **Mutual funds vs. ETFs**: NAV pricing, expense ratios, tracking error, in-kind creation
- **The indexing case**: why most active managers underperform their benchmark net of fees over a decade

Produce `04-fund-vs-direct.md` containing:

1. **Name the closest fund / ETF.** What is the fund or ETF that owns either *this exact position* or a basket of close substitutes? (For NVDA: SMH semiconductor ETF, QQQ, VOO. For a corporate bond: a credit ETF like LQD or a maturity-matched bond fund. For a small private business: not applicable — say so and skip the rest.) Name the fund, its expense ratio, and the position's weight in it.

2. **The single-position vs. fund comparison.** A two-column table: rows = expected return, volatility, Sharpe, idiosyncratic risk exposure, fees, liquidity. Columns = direct position vs. closest fund. Be honest about what you *can* know and what you can't.

3. **The argument for direct.** Two sentences. What about *this* position justifies single-name exposure when a fund containing it is available? Either you have a thesis the fund-weight does not reflect, or you accept that the variance reduction is worth the expected-return concentration.

4. **The argument for the fund.** Two sentences. The default case. Lower variance at the same expected return; the law-of-large-numbers bet from the chapter.

5. **The recommendation.** One sentence. Which one and why — and what specific evidence would flip the recommendation.
```

---

**What this produces:** A markdown document `04-fund-vs-direct.md` containing the closest fund, the comparison table, the arguments on both sides, and a recommendation with the flipping condition named.

**How to adapt this prompt:**

- *For your own project:* Replace any bracketed domain placeholder with your specific instrument, ticker, or context. The exercise structure is instrument-agnostic; the content is yours.
- *For ChatGPT / Gemini:* Works as-is. For ChatGPT, save the running memo to a Custom GPT instead of a Claude Project. For Gemini, paste the project's accumulated section files into the context window each session.
- *For Claude Code:* Not needed.
- *For a Claude Project:* Append to the project. The fund-vs-direct call interacts with Chapter 8's diversification analysis and Chapter 10's allocation decision — flag the linkage.

**Connection to previous chapters:** Chapter 3 framed the claim type; Chapter 4 asks whether direct ownership of that claim type is dominated by a fund version.

**Preview of next chapter:** Chapter 5 produces the *DCF section* of the memo — the present-value valuation that the recommendation must defend.

The ideas in this chapter didn't appear from nowhere. **Sylvia Porter** was writing personal-finance journalism for ordinary investors from 1935 onward — at a time when funds and indexed exposure to equities were treated as products for the wealthy alone decades before most people had heard of mutual funds, ETFs, and how ordinary investors get diversified equity exposure. Here's a prompt to find out more — and then make it better.

figures in this chapter. Each produces a standalone HTML file you can open
in a browser and modify freely.

**Prerequisites:** Load `brutalist/CLAUDE.md` and `brutalist/DESIGN.md` into
your Claude project context before using these prompts. They define the stack,
naming conventions, color system, and typography the figures use.

### Figure 4.1 — Volatility reduction curve 

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Volatility reduction curve . Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: Volatility reduction curve — x-axis: number of holdings (1 to 100), y-axis: portfolio volatility as fraction of single-asset volatility; show 1/√N decay curve, mark the 4-asset (½ volatility) and 100-asset (1/10 volatility) points explicitly; student should see the curve flattens quickly — most of the benefit comes from the first 20–30 holdings. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.

### Figure 4.2 — Two-part decomposition of portfolio risk 

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Two-part decomposition of portfolio risk . Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: Two-part decomposition of portfolio risk — show total risk splitting into idiosyncratic (eliminated by diversification, shaded, shrinks to zero as N grows) and systematic (irreducible floor at ρσ², solid) as N increases; annotate the floor explicitly with the ρσ² label. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.

### Figure 4.3 — Compounding fee drag over time 

Create a standalone D3 v7 HTML file for Figure Compounding fee drag over time . Use the CDN https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/7.9.0/d3.min.js, inline CSS, ResizeObserver redraw, SVG role="img", aria-labelledby, title, and desc. Build the figure from this structural brief: Compounding fee drag over time — two lines on same axes, x-axis: years (0–35), y-axis: portfolio value ($); low-fee line reaches ~$103,900, high-fee line reaches ~$76,900; shade the gap between them and label it "$27,000 — the cost of 0.95% per year over 35 years"; student should see the gap widens nonlinearly. Use the described data shape and labels; when exact values are not supplied, use plausible illustrative values that preserve the relationships in the brief. Use a zero baseline for bars or areas, direct labels where possible, and annotations named in the brief. Use only DESIGN.md color variables and the required serif/mono font split.
